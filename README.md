# AmongRust ඞ ඞ ඞ ඞ ඞ ඞ ඞ 

AmongRust is a tool developed by scientists and researchers at MAT. It reveals the imposters you've been hiding in your sus code (get it? source code LOL). Basically, AmongRust changes `enum` and `struct` names in your code to reveal the sussiness within.

AmongRust is totally non-destructive, and your code should work as normal (maybe), but no guarantees.
Be careful, the imposters may be very few, or outrageously many. This is a feature, not a bug, and there is no way to remove the imposters. ඞ ඞ ඞ ඞ ඞ ඞ ඞ 


I'm just kidding you can reverse the effect by using the "IAMTHEIMPOSTER" argument like `amongrust -- IAMTHEIMPOSTER`, which is very sus if you ask me.
It is possible to undo the changes made to your code because of my IMPOSTER-DETECTION-ALGORITHM which took me 9 years to develop.

Of course, you can also manually delete the comments if you want, because they're just comments, but i highly recommend using the "IAMTHEIMPOSTER" argument because that's what it was made for.

Note: this crate was made by [Hiro](https://twitter.com/0x1hiro) at 2AM in his mum's basement. There is no guarantee that it will work as expected. Use AmongRust at your own risk. It took 34 long minutes to start and finish this AMBITIOUS project. Please give this project a star on [Github](https://github.com/0xhiro/amongrust) and subscribe to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv3SId-GfOT7MCaHVl88SQQ) for fun programming videos, well, except you are an impo****

# USAGE

`cargo install amongrust`

That's it. you're done. Now run `amongrust` in your project directory, then check your sus code.

How to undo: `amongrust -- IAMTHEIMPOSTER`


DO NOT USE AMONGRUST IN YOUR COMPANY'S CODEBASE!!!
